# MailSlit
MailSlit is a web-based application that helps users efficiently manage their email subscriptions. By scanning the user's Gmail inbox, the app identifies subscription emails and provides an easy way to unsubscribe from them or mark them as spam. This project utilizes the Gmail API and provides a clean interface for email management.

## Features
- **Scan Gmail for Subscription Emails:** The app searches for emails containing "unsubscribe" links or subscription-related keywords.
- **Unsubscribe Functionality:** Users can unsubscribe from mailing lists directly within the app.
- **Email Categorization:** Emails are categorized by sender, giving users a clear view of subscription emails from different sources.
- **Mark as Spam:** If unsubscribing is not available, users can mark emails as spam to block future emails from that sender.
- **Google OAuth2 Integration:** Securely log in and authorize the app to scan and manage subscription emails using OAuth2.
